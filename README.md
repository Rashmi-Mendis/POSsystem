**Sales and Inventory Management System**  
**Published on:** October 13, 2021  

## **Project Overview**  
The **Sales and Inventory Management System** is a computer-based application designed to improve the efficiency of inventory and sales tracking for retailers. The system is developed to assist stores like **Sisira Stores in Weligatta**, which previously relied on manual record-keeping, leading to inefficiencies and data inaccuracies.  

With this system, store owners can effectively manage stock levels, generate sales reports, issue customer receipts, and track product expiration dates. It provides an **integrated Point of Sales (POS) system**, ensuring real-time synchronization of sales and inventory data.

## **Problem Statement**  
Retail businesses, particularly small and medium-sized stores, often struggle with **inventory mismanagement** and **manual record-keeping inefficiencies**. **Sisira Stores** currently faces the following challenges:  

🔹 **Manual Inventory Tracking** – The store uses spreadsheets and logbooks, leading to data inconsistencies.  
🔹 **Lack of Sales Reporting** – Sales summaries are based only on the cash register total, making fraud detection difficult.  
🔹 **No Expiration Date Alerts** – Expired products remain on shelves, causing losses.  
🔹 **Incomplete Customer Receipts** – Customers do not receive detailed receipts, complicating returns and exchanges.  

To address these issues, this project provides a **computerized system** that enhances inventory and sales management.
